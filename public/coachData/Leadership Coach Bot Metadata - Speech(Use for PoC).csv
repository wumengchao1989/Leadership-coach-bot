,,Shawni,Career Development,"For me, the major reason why I decided to going into a technology related field is that I love creating things. I used to write all the time while I was growing up, I love drawing, and I enjoy playing video games. Technology (specifically programming) always seemed like the natural next step to finding better ways to express myself. Luckily I had a family that was pretty supportive of letting me explore my interests, and helped provided the tools to do so. The fact that I get to spend my day creating things and solving puzzles is very rewarding to me, and makes me very glad that I chose this career path.

My experience as being a ""woman in tech"" has been fairly positive, and one that I've found pretty rewarding. For women who find they enjoy technology and wish to pursue it professionally, my major suggestion is to make friends with people in the industry. That means both men and women that can help form the basis of support network. That way if you do run into the odd company that has that ""Oh, you're a girl and you don't know about this tech stuff,"" vibe going on, you don't have to stay there (or alternatively, assume all places are like that and quit the tech industry). The nice thing about being someone with strong technical skills, is that your skills are in high enough demand that you can find work elsewhere, and with a strong network of friends, finding a healthy place to work is a lot easier. In general, most places actually are awesome to work at as a woman, and you don't have to stay at a place that doesn't treat you with respect.

When it comes to leadership positions or in general progressing in your career, I have a few suggestions. First, always find ways to keep learning, even if it's just doing fun projects for yourself a few nights of the week. This is an industry that is constantly changing - making sure you keep your skills fresh will help you stay ahead. Second, I found that sometimes to get there, you have to take the initiative and maybe get outside of your comfort zone. For me, I started running local tech meetups for web development (since there weren't any in the area at the time), and practicing public speaking by talking at events on tech topics I was interested in. That helped people get to know me, and where my expertise was, and opened up leadership opportunities for me. If you allow yourself to be quiet in the background, no one will know who you are.

Overall, I've enjoyed my time in technology, and if you're interested, I highly suggest you try it out.","technology related field, creating things, writing, drawing, video games, programming, express myself, supportive family, solving puzzles, career path, woman in tech, positive experience, rewarding, professional pursuit, industry friends, support network, technical skills, high demand, work environment, respect, leadership positions, career progression, continuous learning, fun projects, industry changes, skills, initiative, comfort zone, local tech meetups, web development, public speaking, tech topics, expertise, leadership opportunities, background, technology enjoyment."
,,Shawni,Career Development,"Personally I've found the biggest advantage and disadvantage to being a woman in tech actually comes from the same place; the fact some people, (I've found it to be the minority, though this may be partially related to my being in a public facing role and others often knowing a little about me prior to actually meeting me in person) look at you and think you're going to be at best unintelligent and at worst, dumb. This is especially true if you're young and/or you don't look like a stereotypical ""nerd"".

The disadvantage is that you may not be asked for input or have to work harder to prove yourself in new teams. The advantage is that when someone forms this opinion, wrongly, you are given an opportunity to both make them question and hopefully improve their preconceived notions about women in tech, and to surprise them in a way our male counterparts are unable to, often giving you an edge and immediate credibility. For example, my typical response when it is presumed I'm a secretary and asked to fetch coffee is to respond with something like; ""Sure, if you don't mind waiting while I finish debugging this module; I can do it while it's compiling."" - it's polite and let's them reevaluate without feeling too embarrassed.

Of course, if someone says something like the all-too-common; ""you're too hot to be smart!"" (face palm) then you can always ask something deeply technical you know will make them feel clueless, which is fair enough in the face of rudeness.

The way I've handled this over the years has varied depending on the situation, what helped me most was advice from my mentor and partner, Carlos Icaza (R.I.P.), who told me years ago when he was my boss; ""You'll have to work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously with some people- and for a small group, you're never going to win them over- that's the sad truth... but most people aren't like that, and though it might seem cruel you have to work that much harder, you'll find it's worth it when working with the right people, because to them, like to me, they won't see you as a woman in tech, they'll see you as a rockstar of an engineer who is way ahead of most peers and has an amazing work ethic. That extra work you have to put in might be unfair, but it will make you a genius in your field, an outlier, and that ends up being more than worth it, because the ones that passionate, that dedicated, regardless of gender, are the ones who end up running companies."" - in my experience, he was, as usual, completely right. It may not be fair, but I wouldn't be half as successful as I am if I hadn't taken that advice to heart.","woman in tech, advantage, disadvantage, public facing role, preconceived notions, prove yourself, new teams, credibility, secretary stereotype, debugging, module, compiling, rudeness, mentor, Carlos Icaza, work ethic, engineer, outlier, running companies, success, advice."
,,Shawni,Career Development,"What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of being a woman in tech, and what would you say to women who consider a career in the tech industry?

Honestly I do not see any disadvantages to being a woman in tech. If more women chose tech occupations, I honestly believe women would absolutely kill the game as a group. I would advise women to first, research female tech leaders, and second, research female coders. It's important to get a good sense of all the possibilities that could unfold in your career, and create factual frames of references that replace all the myths around our industry.

What do you think is the best way to overcome gender bias and discrimination (did you encounter any gender bias and discrimination and if yes, how did you deal with it?)?

I’ve experienced some microaggressions as a woman in the tech industry, but ultimately, my path in getting out of that was starting my own business. In starting my own business, I came out of my introverted shell and I developed a boldness that I didn’t have when I was in corporate America. Today, most of my clients are male, and they are extremely professional, fun to work with, and most of all, they trust the decisions I make in the interest of their brand. I would tell all women, whether they work for themselves or not, to not buy in to the stereotypes, and not matter what, DO NOT SHRINK. Do not internalize the sexist attitudes directed at you.

When it comes to gender bias regarding unequal pay, I agree 100% with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. In her book Lean In, she talks about having open conversations about pay and salaries with other women. It’s an unsaid thing, but keeping your salary quiet is encouraged in the workplace. Women should be more open with each other, even in a corporate setting, to form solidarity.","advantages, disadvantages, woman in tech, career, tech industry, female tech leaders, female coders, career possibilities, myths, gender bias, discrimination, microaggressions, own business, introverted shell, boldness, corporate America, clients, stereotypes, sexist attitudes, unequal pay, Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg, Lean In, open conversations, pay, salaries, workplace, solidarity."
,,Shawni,Career Development,"What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of being a woman in tech, and what would you say to women who consider a career in the tech industry?

Working in tech requires a lot of dedication, this can be challenging for women sometimes, but it’s not different from many other fields, it’s just a matter of choice. I never experienced any form of sexism, or at least I never been aware of this, and this is of course a good thing. I see many women really appreciated for what they do in tech. So, in general I would speak of working in tech in general, because in my opinion advantages and downsides extend to men as well. I especially like to get in touch with other people from all around the world and improve my skills thanks to the huge community out there. Other fields are not that open.

What do you think is the best way to prevent women from leaving tech, and what is the best way for women to get leadership positions?

It would be interesting to know why they decide to leave the field. If I would decide to leave tech it would be not related with difficulties in get leadership positions but because of other priorities in my life. It would be nice to see more women considering work in this field, it’s probably more scaring when seen from the outside.

What do you think is the best way to overcome gender bias and discrimination (did you encounter any gender bias and discrimination and if yes, how did you deal with it?)?

As said above, I never experienced any form of discrimination, but I know some women did. Well, if this happens, probably you are dealing with the wrong people. In that case is also good to share the experience with the community, so we can raise more awareness.","advantages, disadvantages, woman in tech, career, tech industry, dedication, sexism, appreciation, global community, skills improvement, prevent women from leaving tech, leadership positions, life priorities, gender bias, discrimination, wrong people, community, awareness."
,,Shawni,Career Development,"What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of being a woman in tech, and what would you say to women who consider a career in the tech industry?

The only disadvantage of being a woman in tech is that, I'm not going to lie, it could be a lonely journey. There still aren't many of us here and this makes space for discrimination, of course. But luckily the winds are turning and there are huge networks of support on the internet and many meet-ups to exchange ideas with other women in tech. Little by little most of the attitudes I dislike are becoming less socially acceptable. It's important to notice that the days of the stereotype of the antissocial nerd are over. To be successful in the most interesting jobs in technology nowadays, being a great communicator and working well in a team is as important as technical skills if not more. Since diverse teams communicate better, this is a highly valued skill today and the best companies are paying attention on that.

Concerning the advantages, I believe thy are the same for everyone. It's a nice career with great salaries perspectives. Let's be honest, most jobs seen as """"""female jobs"""""" aren't as highly valued. If they aren't as highly valued because they're taken as feminine or if they are taken as feminine because they aren't as highly valued is not an important question to the point I'm trying to make. The point is that tech is valued. And it's time to take some space and occupy the tech market. Which, great news, actually isn't a very difficult task. The market is always in need of tech people and it's easy to find a job nearly everywhere in the world. It's a highly flexible and modern industry, where things such as flexible hours, remote work and home office are not rare. The challenges of the tech career are interesting, it can be stressful sometimes, but sometimes I feel like they are puzzles I love to solve. I love my job and would absolutely recommend it. Not to mention it's also a great foundation for those who are interested to go on an entrepreneurial path. Since all great companies and ideas nowadays are bound to need technical knowledge even at early stages. Last but not least, it's also amazing to see that the technical mindset of constantly trying to improve and fix things often propagates beyond the technical area. Most of my colleagues are people interested on the betterment of society and they are absolutely wonderful people to have around.

What do you think is the best way to overcome gender bias and discrimination (did you encounter any gender bias and discrimination and if yes, how did you deal with it?)?

The best way is to remember that we absolutely do NOT have to deal with obnoxious issues if we don't want to. From the company's side, it is incredibly hard to hire good professionals. If you are not being treated nicely in an environment, leave. Get right off there immediately. Talk to your network or find other women on the internet and on meet-ups, and look for a better job that actually deserves your skills to be put into use. Companies are not doing you a favor by giving you a job, remember they get a financial profit. So I like making sure that my vision and the vision of the company I work for are well-aligned. And this has to come from the top management all the way down, not the contrary. Struggling to fix some issues from the bottom-up sometimes is not worth it. There are more than enough non-toxic places so we don't have to stay in the toxic ones.

I know this is easier saying than doing. I have encountered heavy discrimination in one of my previous jobs and standing up for myself did not come naturally. Of course I was worried about keeping my job and receive my salary at the end of the month. I had my bills to pay and I felt I depended on it. It is not so simple. We always believe some things are not going to happen to us. Then they do and we don't react as we imagine we would. What happened is that putting up with such discriminatory attitudes, directed at me and at others, eventually drained me until I was not doing a good job anymore and one day I had enough and had burst that got me fired. I got desperate for being unemployed during precisely only three days until I found a job that I loved with amazing people, that I left only because I moved to another country. So the one thing I learned is that I should have stood up for myself sooner, actually. And this is the lesson I'd like to pass on.","advantages, disadvantages, woman in tech, career, tech industry, loneliness, discrimination, support networks, internet, meet-ups, stereotypes, communication, team work, technical skills, diverse teams, salary perspectives, female jobs, valued, tech market, flexible hours, remote work, home office, challenges, puzzles, entrepreneurial path, technical knowledge, societal betterment, gender bias, obnoxious issues, professional environment, network, company vision, top management, non-toxic workplaces, discrimination experience, standing up, unemployment, moving countries."

That is, don't take yourself our of the industry because you think it's hostile towards your gender.

,,Michael,"Experience,Sharing,Stories","Leaders of Inspiration: I have been fortunate to work with great leaders, and if we pay attention to how they make things happen, how they communicate, and how they touch the people around them, we can learn immensely, this means practical learning difficult to obtain from books. Let me highlight 3 of them. José Oliveira is like a chess player, any move was planned, and is 5 steps ahead of other players, with the enormous ability to make things happen and decide. Not afraid to take risks and do experimental projects. Artur Baptista is very objective and oriented to identify and solve problems, keeping the focus on priorities, involving people, and accompanying them when problems happen to work in solution as a member of the team. João Cruz, a very human, diplomat, is a person with great vision, is very intelligent, and with a lot of culture and knowledge of different subjects. Great ability to correlate information and generate many innovative and differentiating ideas for the company's business. I was lucky enough to work and follow these 3 people and learn a lot about the best of each one so as to create my own style and not try to copy their style.","Leaders of Inspiration, great leaders, practical learning, José Oliveira, chess player, planning, risk-taking, experimental projects, Artur Baptista, objective, problem-solving, focus, priorities, team involvement, João Cruz, human, diplomat, vision, intelligence, culture, knowledge, innovative ideas, business differentiation, personal style."
,,,"Experience,Sharing,Stories","Inspirational teams: not only leaders are the inspiration models, but I also had the chance to lead people with completely different styles and unique characteristics that combined with other people brought exceptional results to the team. Learning with each one and being able to share the best of each other allowed us to create a true team, solid, collaborative and united in a common goal, team success, and not just individual. Again, it is always difficult to highlight some people and their characteristics, but let me share the ones that have marked me the most. Rui Eusebio, excellent to find the problem and even better to find solutions. Improvement and learning is the way. Maximum confidence and humility, a natural leader! Rui Coimbra, make things happen, if you need someone to ""run a marathon"", he does not care if he is in the right preparation, he will not leave you alone and will ""run"" with you! Pedro Tavares is resilient, cares about people, and brings life and good humor to our days. Sara Pinto: Straight to the point. Objectivity with class and education. Susana Banha: Know how to involve others and make them our allies. Ricardo Santos, thinks differently, creatively and out of the box, let him ""fly"" because we need this kind of person in the team. Rui Maia: Diplomat, addicted to knowledge, future leader. Create one of the best programming sites when he was 15 years old. Henrique Dantas: vision, ambition, risk, and confidence. He left the company 6 months after joining us to create a startup in London. Sofia Teixeira: Customer-oriented, doing a job wrong is not an option. Her background as a journalist reminds me why journalists are today one of the hiring trends for technology teams, customer focus is essential to the success of any business. Of course, there are many others with great capabilities.","Inspirational teams, lead people, different styles, unique characteristics, exceptional results, team success, Rui Eusebio, problem-solving, improvement, learning, confidence, humility, natural leader, Rui Coimbra, resilience, Pedro Tavares, good humor, Sara Pinto, objectivity, Susana Banha, involvement, allies, Ricardo Santos, creative thinking, Rui Maia, diplomat, knowledge, programming, Henrique Dantas, vision, ambition, risk, startup, Sofia Teixeira, customer-oriented, journalist background, hiring trends, technology teams, business success."
,,,"Experience,Sharing,Stories","Experimental projects/technologies: I have had the opportunity to work closely with universities, received many students for internships, and also worked with startups as a mentor. It was amazing how many things we can learn by doing experimental projects and how important this can be to your team. First, you can involve your team and collect your ideas, turning ideas into experimental projects. The internships are the possibility to make your idea real, they can sense the evolution, contribute to continuous improvement and learn new knowledge! For the trainee student, it is a great experience because they will have the chance to be 100% responsible for an experimental project whose risk of failure does not impact their careers but success can be an accelerator for the opportunities that follow. They have full autonomy to choose technologies and perform as they believe is the best way. Once again, I was fortunate to receive great students who have done amazing projects and today I am working with most of them. I realize that engaging my team in different projects in themes that do not dominate, brings great results in terms of motivation and learning, people will have to think outside the box.

,,,"News,Announcement","I’m excited to share that we are planning our first Co-Location Day to meet our colleagues in person! 
Technological advances have led to a strong increase in the number of data collection efforts aimed at measuring co-presence of individuals at different spatial resolutions. It is however unclear how much co-presence data can inform us on actual face-to-face contacts, of particular interest to study the structure of a population in social groups or for use in data-driven models of information or epidemic spreading processes. Here, we address this issue by leveraging data sets containing high resolution face-to-face contacts as well as a coarser spatial localisation of individuals, both temporally resolved, in various contexts. The co-presence and the face-to-face contact temporal networks share a number of structural and statistical features, but the former is (by definition) much denser than the latter. We thus consider several down-sampling methods that generate surrogate contact networks from the co-presence signal and compare them with the real face-to-face data. We show that these surrogate networks reproduce some features of the real data but are only partially able to identify the most central nodes of the face-to-face network. We then address the issue of using such down-sampled co-presence data in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes, and in identifying efficient containment strategies. We show that the performance of the various sampling methods strongly varies depending on context. We discuss the consequences of our results with respect to data collection strategies and methodologies.","Co-Location Day, colleagues, technological advances, data collection, co-presence, individuals, spatial resolutions, face-to-face contacts, social groups, data-driven models, information spreading, epidemic spreading processes, high resolution, temporal networks, structural features, statistical features, down-sampling methods, surrogate contact networks, central nodes, epidemic simulations, containment strategies, sampling methods, context, data collection strategies, methodologies."
